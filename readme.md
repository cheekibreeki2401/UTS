<h2>Welcome to UTS</h2>
UTS is a program designed to make the navigation of file systems and finding particular files easier by using simple lists combined with tags for your conveniance. Create lists of files or directories you want to keep track of in individual lists which then can be further seperated for up to 10 tags. Currently, the commandline version of the program <strong>CUTS</strong> has been created for linux systems, with further improvements on the way.
<h2>How to use</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Git clone the source folder for your desired version of the UTS. For now, that would be CUTS, which can be done by using this command:

        >
        >    git clone https://github.com/cheekibreeki2401/UTS/tree/master/CUTS/src
        >

    </li>
    <li>Use your compiler of choice to compile the c files. The one I have currently tested on gcc with simply using:

        >   gcc *.c -o CUTS

    </li>
    <li>Run the program of your choice by terminal using:

        >
        >    ./CUTS
        >

    </li>

    <li>Follow prompts to start building your lists, simple!</li>
</ol>
